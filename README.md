  # Initial React Notes

  ## Why Does React Exist?

  * Compartmentalize!
      * Thanks to components!
  * Facebook's engineering team invented it to make it **easier to make Facebook**.

  ## Structure of a React App:

  * Top level is still `index.html`!
      * It's basically an empty box where React will render stuff.
  * `main.jsx` is where we use our Vanilla JS skills to select the `<div id="root">` element, then render our React app inside of it.
  * `App.jsx` is our React app! It's the top level component.

  ## Transpiling

  * A React app uses JSX, which cannot be directly rendered by a browser.
      * Browser only can read HTML|JS|CSS.
  * JSX needs to be "translated" or "compiled" into HTML|JS|CSS.
      * Hence, "transpiled."
  * The reason you must run your React app on a localhost port is because of this.
      * Every time you modify and save a file in your React app, Vite (or whatever build tool you're using) re-transpiles your app.
  * Vite is the "build tool" that does this process for us automatically!
      * `npm run dev` is what starts Vite. ðŸ™‚
